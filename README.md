## Software Design and Database

The Inventory Management System follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) for a clean and maintainable codebase. It's designed with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate the application's concerns. Additionally, it uses Entity Framework for local data management and Firestore, an online database, for enabling remote access and data synchronization from anywhere the application is installed.
